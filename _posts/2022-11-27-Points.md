# Points for hacks (3 points)
- 2.5/3 for trying and it is visible that the code segment made works somewhat
- 3/3 for completion and the code segment works
- more than 2.5 if code segment is very close to completion

# How to submit Homework
- Copy the list from the homework page, [Challenge and Homework](https://dillonlee06.github.io/ZestyYeungsReborn/jupyter/week%2013/2022/11/27/Challenge-and-Homework.html), that contains the albums and songs.
    - Make sure not to copy the challenge list
- Paste the list into your individual Fastpages
- Edit the code so that the desired output is given and submit a link to your post (not a review ticket) in the comments below along with your full name.
