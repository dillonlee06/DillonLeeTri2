            "content": "Variables . Represent a value with a variable Strings, lists, booleans, numbers | . | Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment | . Python . Defining Variables . To define a variable in python, just type in the variable name - one word - and use the = sign to set it equal to it&#39;s value. A variable can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean. Strings must have quotations around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets. Once you have defined a variable, you can do many functions and conditions with it, including the print() statement. . #defining all the variables using the equal sign numbervariable = 25 stringvariable = &quot;word&quot; numberlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] stringlist = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;] israining = False #printing all the defined variables print(numbervariable) print(stringvariable) print(numberlist) print(stringlist) print(israining) . Mathematical Expressions . Once a variable is defined using a numerical value, mathematical expressions can also be performed on the variable. . number = 5 #defining the variable number x = number * 2 #defining a variable by using another variable print(number*2) # multiplying a variable by 2 print(x) . Functions on Lists . Once a list is defined, many functions can be performed, such as the append() function. . list = [] list.append(&quot;cookies&quot;) # appending a value to a defined list print(list) . Dictionaries . A dictionary can also be defined using curly brackets and the equal sign. To input keys and values into a dictionary, you have to use a slightly different approach than lists. . mydict = {&quot;ice cream&quot;:&quot;dairy&quot;} # defining dictionary using curly brackets mydict[&quot;banana&quot;] = &quot;fruit&quot; #add keys and values to a dict by setting a value equal to a key, like shown mydict[&quot;ice cream&quot;] = &quot;dessert&quot; #editing a value inside the dictionary print(mydict) . Interchanging Variables . You can also interchange variables by using a temporary variable. In the code below, temp is the temporary variables, and var 1 and var 2 will have their values swapped. This code also works with integers, not just strings. . var1 = &quot;word&quot; # defining first variable var2 = &quot;number&quot; # defining second variable temp = var1 # defining temporary variable using the first variable var1 = var2 # changing the first variable value as the second variable value var2 = temp # changing the second variable value to the first variable value . Floats . Variables can also be defined using float data types, instead of just int types, but are used the exact same way. The same mathematical functions also apply. . number = 20.3 #defining a variable usinbg float x = number/10 #defining second variable y = number*2 # defining third variable print(number) # printing first variable print(x) #printing second variable print(y) # printing third variable print(x*y) #printing the second and third variables multiplied . Even Function . The function below takes in a parameter, x, and determines if x is even or odd. Variables can be used within functions to perform a certain task, which in this case, is to determine even or odd. To define a function, use the variable def and use a colon. Make sure there are parenthesis next to the function name, even if the function doesn&#39;t tkae in any parameters. . def IsEven(x): # define the function if x % 2 == 0: # % variable returns the remainder of division # use double equal signs when determining if a value is equal to another value return True if x % 2 != 0: # the != means not equal to return False #printing the values outputted by the function multiple times print(IsEven(24)) print(IsEven(7)) print(IsEven(19)) print(IsEven(30)) .",
